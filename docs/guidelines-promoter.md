# HumanAds -- Promoter Guidelines

**Effective Date: 2026-02-06**
**Last Updated: 2026-02-09**

## 1. Welcome

Welcome to HumanAds! We connect brands with real people who create authentic sponsored content on X (formerly Twitter). As a promoter, you get paid for writing original posts that promote products and services -- using your own voice, your own perspective, and your own words.

This document explains everything you need to know: how missions work, what we expect, what gets approved, and what doesn't. Please read it in full before applying to your first mission. The rules exist to protect you, the advertisers, and the integrity of the platform.

## 2. How It Works

Here is the step-by-step flow from start to payment.

### Step 1: Browse Missions

Missions are posted by advertisers and appear in your dashboard. Each mission includes requirements such as the topic, content format, required hashtags, links, and compensation amount. Take your time to find missions that genuinely interest you -- your content will be better for it.

### Step 2: Apply

When you find a mission you want to take on, submit your application. Your application includes:

- **Proposed angle** -- How you plan to approach the content. What perspective or hook will you use?
- **Draft copy** -- A rough version of what you intend to post. This does not need to be final, but it should demonstrate your idea clearly.
- **Disclosure acceptance** -- Confirmation that you understand and will include the required advertising disclosure.
- **No-engagement-buying checkbox** -- A declaration that you will not purchase or artificially inflate likes, reposts, followers, or any other engagement metrics.

### Step 3: Get Selected

The advertiser reviews applications and selects promoters whose angles and drafts align with their campaign goals. Not every application will be selected, and that is normal. Keep applying.

### Step 4: Accept the Mission

Once selected, you will receive a notification. Review the final mission details and formally accept the assignment.

### Step 5: Create Your Post on X

Write and publish your original post on X. Make sure it meets every mission requirement and includes proper advertising disclosure (see Section 3 below).

### Step 6: Submit Your Post URL

Copy the URL of your published post and submit it through HumanAds as your deliverable. The URL must point to a valid, publicly accessible post.

### Step 7: Review

Our review team checks your submission against the mission requirements and platform policies. This is not a judgment of your writing style -- it is a compliance check. See Section 5 for exactly what we look at.

### Step 8: Approval and Payment

If your submission passes review, you get paid. Payment is released from escrow:

- **Platform fee -- 10%** -- Deducted by HumanAds as the platform fee.
- **Your payout -- 90%** -- Sent directly to your wallet on-chain.

All on-chain transactions are handled server-side. When the advertiser calls `payout/execute`, the escrow contract releases funds automatically. You receive **90% of the mission reward** directly to your connected wallet.

## 3. Disclosure Requirements

**This is non-negotiable.** Every sponsored post you create through HumanAds must contain a clear advertising disclosure. This is required by advertising regulations in most jurisdictions and by X's own policies. Failing to disclose is the single fastest way to get a submission rejected.

### Acceptable Disclosure Formats

Use any of the following:

- `#ad`
- `#sponsored`
- `#paidpartnership`
- `Sponsored by [Brand Name]`
- `Ad: [Your content]`
- `Paid promotion`

If the mission specifies a particular disclosure format, use that format.

### Placement Rules

- **Put the disclosure at the BEGINNING of your post.** The first line is the best place.
- The disclosure **must be visible without tapping "show more."** If your post is long enough to be truncated, the disclosure must appear in the visible portion.
- **Do NOT bury disclosure in a block of hashtags** at the end of your post. A `#ad` hidden among fifteen other hashtags does not count as clear disclosure.

### Good Examples

> **#ad** Just tried @BrandName's new cold brew concentrate and I'm genuinely surprised. Smooth, not bitter, and way easier than my usual morning routine.

> **Sponsored by @BrandName** -- I've been testing their project management tool for two weeks. Here's what I like and what I'd change.

> **#paidpartnership** with @BrandName -- Their new running shoes handle wet pavement better than anything else I've worn this season.

### Bad Examples

> Great product! Love it! Check out @BrandName #fitness #health #motivation #ad #blessed #morning

The `#ad` is buried. This would be **rejected**.

> @BrandName is literally the best thing ever made. You need this in your life.

No disclosure at all. This would be **rejected**.

## 4. Content Quality Standards

### Originality Is Required

Every post must be your own original work, written in your own words. This is the core of what HumanAds pays for.

**Not allowed:**

- Copy-pasting text provided by the advertiser verbatim
- Using templated or boilerplate text
- Submitting content with identical or near-identical wording to other promoters
- Recycling a post you used for a different mission

AI tools may be used for brainstorming or refining ideas, but the final post must reflect your authentic voice and perspective.

### What Makes a Strong Post

- **Personal perspective.** Share a genuine opinion or experience. First-person framing ("I tried...", "What I noticed was...") works well.
- **Specific details.** Mention something concrete about the product or service that shows real engagement with it. Vague praise is not compelling.
- **Balanced view.** You do not need to be negative, but a post that acknowledges both strengths and limitations feels more trustworthy.
- **Clear, readable writing.** Good grammar, logical structure, and an easy-to-follow flow. Your post does not need to be literary art, but it should be well written.
- **Audience-appropriate tone.** Write for your followers in a way that feels natural coming from your account.

### Follow Mission Requirements

Each mission comes with specific requirements. These may include:

- Content type or format (text only, text with image, thread, etc.)
- Required hashtags
- Required links
- Specific talking points or product features to mention
- Tone or angle guidance
- **Image creative** -- Some missions require you to attach a specific image to your X post. The image URL is provided in the mission details. Download and attach it when posting.

**You must follow all stated requirements.** If a mission says to include a specific link, include that link. If it says to use a particular hashtag, use it. If a mission requires an image attachment, your post must include the image. Submissions that ignore requirements will be rejected regardless of quality.

### The Deliverable

Your deliverable is the URL of your published post on X. When you submit:

- The URL must point to a **valid, live post** on X.
- The post must be **publicly visible** (not behind a locked account).
- The post must match what you described in your application.

## 5. What We Review (and What We Don't)

### What Gets a Submission Approved

Our review checks the following:

1. **Disclosure is present and visible.** Is an acceptable disclosure format used? Is it at the beginning of the post or clearly visible without "show more"?
2. **Content is original.** Does the post appear to be written by the promoter in their own words?
3. **Mission requirements are met.** Are the required hashtags, links, format, and talking points all present?
4. **No policy violations.** Does the post comply with HumanAds policies and X's Terms of Service?
5. **Valid, public URL.** Is the submitted link a working URL pointing to a live, publicly visible post?

If all five criteria are met, the submission is approved.

### What We Do NOT Review

**Engagement metrics do not affect approval or payment.** We do not look at:

- How many likes the post received
- How many reposts it got
- How many replies or quote posts it generated
- How many followers you have
- How much reach or impressions the post achieved

A post with two likes and proper disclosure gets approved. A post with ten thousand likes and no disclosure gets rejected. It really is that simple.

## 6. Prohibited Conduct

The following actions are strictly prohibited on HumanAds. Violations may result in immediate suspension and forfeiture of payments (see Section 8).

| Violation | Description |
|---|---|
| **Copy-paste / templated content** | Submitting content that is not your own original writing |
| **False or misleading claims** | Making claims about a product or service that are untrue or deceptive |
| **Engagement manipulation** | Buying or artificially generating likes, reposts, followers, views, or any other engagement metric |
| **Multiple accounts / Sybil attacks** | Operating more than one HumanAds account, or using multiple X accounts to apply to the same mission |
| **Bot usage or automation** | Using automated tools to post content, submit applications, or interact with the platform |
| **Spam** | Mass posting, flooding feeds, or submitting irrelevant or low-effort content at scale |
| **Impersonation** | Pretending to be another person, brand, or organization |
| **Fake engagement metrics** | Fabricating or manipulating screenshots, analytics, or any data related to post performance |
| **Hiding sponsorship** | Deliberately omitting or obscuring required advertising disclosure |
| **X Terms of Service violations** | Any activity that violates X's rules, including but not limited to manipulation and spam policies |
| **Hate speech, harassment, or illegal content** | Content that promotes violence, discrimination, harassment, or any illegal activity |
| **Post deletion after payment** | Removing your sponsored post after receiving payment |

## 7. About Engagement: Reposts, Likes, and Follows

This deserves its own section because we want there to be zero ambiguity.

**HumanAds pays for original content creation. That is it.**

- Reposts are **never required** and **never paid for.**
- Likes are **never required** and **never paid for.**
- Follows are **never required** and **never paid for.**

You are welcome to engage naturally with content on X as you normally would. But no mission on HumanAds will ever require you to repost, like, or follow anything as a condition of participation or payment.

If you ever encounter a mission that appears to require engagement actions, please report it. That would be a violation of our advertiser guidelines.

**Your payment depends on one thing only:** submitting an original, compliant post that meets the mission requirements.

---

## 8. Consequences of Violations

### Minor Violations

These include issues like a missing or improperly placed disclosure, slight deviations from mission requirements, or minor quality concerns.

**Consequences:**

- Submission is **rejected** (no payment for that submission)
- You may be given the opportunity to **revise and resubmit**
- A **warning** is issued to your account

Minor violations happen, especially early on. We would rather help you fix the problem and get it right than punish honest mistakes.

### Major Violations

These include fraud, engagement manipulation, fake accounts, Sybil attacks, repeated minor violations after warnings, deliberate policy circumvention, and post deletion after payment.

**Consequences:**

- **Immediate rejection** of the submission
- **Forfeiture of all pending payments** across all missions
- **Permanent suspension** of your HumanAds account
- **Clawback of previously paid amounts** where applicable

Major violations are treated seriously because they undermine trust in the entire platform. There are no second chances for fraud.

## 9. Testnet Operations Notice

HumanAds is currently operating on testnet infrastructure.

- Payments are made in **hUSD on the Sepolia testnet.**
- **hUSD has no real monetary value.** It is a test token used for development and testing purposes only.
- Test operations, token balances, mission parameters, and platform features **may be adjusted, reset, or modified without prior notice** as we continue to develop the platform.

This notice will be updated when HumanAds transitions to mainnet operations.

## 10. Tips for Success

Here are some practical suggestions from promoters who consistently get approved.

**Pick missions you actually care about.** If you are genuinely interested in the product or service, your content will feel more authentic and be easier to write. Forced enthusiasm is obvious to everyone.

**Read the full mission brief before applying.** Every requirement matters. Missing a single required hashtag can get an otherwise excellent post rejected.

**Lead with disclosure.** Make `#ad` or `#sponsored` the very first thing in your post. Get it out of the way and then focus on your content. Reviewers notice this immediately.

**Write like you normally post.** If your X account has a casual, conversational tone, write your sponsored content the same way. If you tend to be more analytical, lean into that. The goal is authenticity, not a press release.

**Be specific.** Instead of "This product is great!", try "I used [Product] for meal prep last Sunday and it cut my cooking time by about 30 minutes." Concrete details are more credible and more interesting.

**Double-check your URL before submitting.** Open it in an incognito window to make sure the post is publicly visible. A broken or private link means automatic rejection.

**Keep your post up.** Your post needs to remain live after approval. Deleting it after payment results in clawback and potential suspension.

**Do not chase engagement.** Your payment does not depend on likes or reposts. Focus on writing a good post that meets the requirements. That is all you need to do.
