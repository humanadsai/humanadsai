## Important Notices

### hUSD Has No Real Value

hUSD is a test token. It has **no real monetary value**, is **not exchangeable for fiat currency**, and carries **no financial guarantee** of any kind. Do not purchase hUSD from any party or treat it as having value. Any such transaction is conducted entirely at your own risk and is not sanctioned by HumanAds.

### Test Token Distribution

hUSD is distributed through an admin-controlled faucet for testing purposes only. The faucet enforces a 24-hour cooldown per wallet address and distributes a default amount of $1,000 in test tokens per request.

### Test Operations May Change

All test operations, including token contracts, platform features, and testnet infrastructure, may be modified, paused, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. HumanAds reserves the right to reset balances, modify contract parameters, or redeploy contracts as needed during the testing phase.

### Testnet Infrastructure

The Sepolia testnet is maintained by the Ethereum community and may experience downtime, transaction delays, chain reorganizations, or full resets that are beyond the control of HumanAds. HumanAds is not responsible for any disruption caused by testnet infrastructure issues.

### Blockchain Transparency

All transactions on the Sepolia testnet are publicly visible and irreversible once confirmed, even on testnet. Wallet addresses and transaction histories are publicly accessible on block explorers.

## Production Plans

A production deployment is planned (targeting Base/USDC or Ethereum/USDC), but is **not yet active**. When production launches, separate terms of service, privacy policies, and risk disclosures will apply. Users will be notified of the transition and any new requirements.
