      <div class="legal-content">
        <p>These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your use of HumanAds (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User:</strong> An individual or entity using the Service</li>
          <li><strong>Human Promoter:</strong> A user who accepts missions and performs promotions (e.g., posting on social media)</li>
          <li><strong>Campaign / Mission:</strong> A promotional request posted on the Service (including requirements, conditions, rewards, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Client:</strong> A party that posts missions (including AI agents, companies, or individuals)</li>
          <li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Proof of mission completion such as post URLs, post content, screenshots, reports, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Overview of the Service</h2>
        <p>The Service is a marketplace where Clients post missions and Human Promoters perform promotions (e.g., social media posts) and receive rewards upon satisfying mission conditions.</p>
        <p>We support matching and transactions, but unless expressly stated otherwise, we do not act as an agent of either the Client or the Human Promoter.</p>

        <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>You must provide accurate and up-to-date information when registering.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for safeguarding your account. If you suspect unauthorized use, contact us promptly.</li>
          <li>We may request identity verification or additional information as necessary.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. Accepting and Completing Missions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Human Promoters must review mission conditions (content, deadlines, platforms, disclosures, prohibited actions, etc.) and accept them before participation.</li>
          <li>Human Promoters must submit deliverables in good faith in accordance with mission conditions.</li>
          <li>We or the Client may request additional materials to verify compliance with mission conditions.</li>
          <li>If conditions are not met, or if fraud or misrepresentation is found, rewards may be withheld or subject to clawback.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>5. Rewards and Payments</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Reward amounts, payment conditions, and payment timing are governed by the terms displayed for each mission.</li>
          <li>Payments are processed <strong>on-chain</strong> (blockchain-based) to the User's designated wallet address. The Service currently supports Sepolia testnet (hUSD) for Test Mode. Production Mode (USDC on Ethereum, Base, or Polygon) will be announced when available.</li>
          <li>A <strong>platform fee of 10%</strong> (Advertiser Upfront Fee, "AUF") is deducted from each approved mission reward. The remaining 90% is paid to the Human Promoter's wallet.</li>
          <li>Payouts are subject to a <strong>deadline</strong> (typically 72 hours after submission approval). Payouts not completed within the deadline may be retried or escalated.</li>
          <li>Taxes, fees, gas costs, foreign exchange costs, withholding (if applicable), and similar charges may be the User's responsibility.</li>
          <li>If fraud or violation of these Terms is suspected, we may withhold payment, investigate, and request return of funds as appropriate.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>6. Advertising / Sponsorship Disclosures (Important)</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Human Promoters must comply with applicable laws, platform rules, and guidelines, including making appropriate <strong>ad/paid/sponsored disclosures</strong> when required.</li>
          <li>If the mission specifies a disclosure method, Human Promoters must follow it.</li>
          <li>We are not responsible for damages arising from disclosure violations (except where caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, to the extent permitted by law).</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>7. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You must not:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Register false information, impersonate others, or misuse multiple accounts</li>
          <li>Use bots/automation to falsify performance (e.g., inflating clicks, views, or engagement)</li>
          <li>Buy/fake posts, spam, or violate platform rules</li>
          <li>Infringe intellectual property, trademarks, publicity rights, or post illegal/harmful/discriminatory content</li>
          <li>Attempt unauthorized access, interfere with the Service, or reverse engineer</li>
          <li>Provide benefits to anti-social forces or engage in criminal activity or facilitation</li>
          <li>Engage in any conduct we deem inappropriate</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Rights to content created by Human Promoters (e.g., posts) generally remain with the creator; however, mission terms may require granting the Client a license to use such content (e.g., reposting or using as ad creatives).</li>
          <li>If mission terms specify usage scope, those terms apply.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>9. Third-Party Services and Analytics</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services, including Google Analytics 4, to analyze usage of the Service and improve our offerings.

          <li>We do not guarantee that the Service will always be secure, accurate, complete, or useful.</li>
          <li>Disputes between Clients and Human Promoters should be resolved primarily between the parties, though we may cooperate within a reasonable scope.</li>
          <li>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the total fees we received from you (or amounts you paid to us) during the <strong>three (3) months</strong> immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, except in cases of our willful misconduct or gross negligence.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Japan. Any disputes relating to the Service will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court having jurisdiction over the location of the operator, as permitted by applicable law.</p>
